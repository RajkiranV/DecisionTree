    "*** What is a a Decision tree? ***\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Advantages of Decision Trees ***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "* Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",
    "* The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Disadvantages of Decision Trees ***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems."
